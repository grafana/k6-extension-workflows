# k6-extension-workflows

Set of reusable GitHub workflows to support k6 extension development.

The workflows use composite actions from the [grafana/k6-extension-actions](https://github.com/grafana/k6-extension-actions) repository as building blocks. Using them allows for more flexibility than reusing workflows as is. However, reusing workflows is much easier and more convenient.

## Validate

Opinionated all-in-one workflow, fits most extensions.
